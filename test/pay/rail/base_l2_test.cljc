  "pay.rail.base-l2 — the first real PayRail.

  The bundler and smart account are the two seams the adapter is built on, so
  they are the two things faked here; nothing in this file sends a
  transaction. What the fakes cannot fake is asserted against `erc20.core`
  instead — an independent encoder whose selectors are keccak-verified in its
  own CI — so a wrong recipient or a wrong amount in the calldata is caught."
