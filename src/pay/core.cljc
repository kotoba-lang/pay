  "On-chain creator-payment rail primitives — pure Clojure/ClojureScript.

  Re-homed from `@etzhayyim/sdk`'s payment surface (`pay.ts`: pay /
  payStream / splitDistribute / escrow) as a vendor-neutral kotoba-lang
  common library (superproject ADR-2607092700), so that vendor apps
  (jk-luxury club-shinshi / net-babiniku, gftdcojp apps, …) can settle
  creator payments (tip / subscribe / PPV) without depending on the
  etzhayyim substrate — whose payment-purpose doctrine prohibits external
  `tip`/`subscription`/`purchase` and therefore was never a valid home for
  this surface.

  Layer contract (same as kotoba-lang/base-l2 / treasury):
  - **zero network I/O** — this namespace never talks to a chain, an RPC,
    or a PDS. Every on-chain effect goes through the `PayRail` protocol,
    which a host backs with real adapters (kotoba-lang/base-l2 for
    RPC/ERC-4337, kotoba-lang/treasury for on-chain verification,
    kotoba-lang/wallet for signing).
  - **zero key custody** — no private key ever enters this library.
    Signing happens on the payer's device (non-custodial), mirroring the
    no-server-key invariant the original SDK stated.
  - **honest default** — `unprovisioned-rail` HOLDs every operation with
    `:pay/unprovisioned-capability` instead of pretending to settle,
    mirroring net-babiniku's `UnprovisionedCapability` (ADR-2607062200).

  Amount representation: USDC base units (micros, 6 decimals) as an
  integer. In ClojureScript this is a JS number — safe below 2^53 micros
  (≈ 9.0e9 USDC), far above any realistic creator payment; wire records
  should carry amounts as strings (see `->receipt`)."
