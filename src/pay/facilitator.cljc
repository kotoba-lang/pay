(ns pay.facilitator
  "x402 facilitator core — the payment-GATEWAY logic as pure Clojure/
  ClojureScript. This is the reusable brain of gftdcojp/nexus-x402 (the
  deployable, edge-hosted x402 facilitator service) and of any seller worker
  that delegates verification instead of vendoring the whole gate.

  Cloudflare's Monetization Gateway is a CENTRAL facilitator: sellers register
  pricing rules and the facilitator verifies payments at the edge. nexus-x402
  is our self-hosted equivalent, and this namespace is its rules engine + the
  standard x402 facilitator decisions (`/verify`, `/settle`) — all pure,
  matching kotoba-lang/pay's invariants (zero-dep, zero network I/O, zero key
  custody). The on-chain settlement/verification I/O is injected by the host
  (nexus-x402 backs it with kotoba-lang/treasury + base-l2); this layer is
  unit-testable without a chain.

  Three pieces:
  1. Rules engine — a seller registry mapping (seller, method, path) to a
     price + pay-to treasury + scheme; first match wins. Lets many sellers
     (shinshi / murakumo / kotobase, each with its OWN treasury) share one
     facilitator without the facilitator holding any keys.
  2. `verify` — the x402 facilitator `/verify` decision: is this payment valid
     for these requirements (pure shape/economic checks + the host's on-chain
     verdict)? Returns {:isValid :invalidReason :payer}.
  3. `settle` / `gate` — the `/settle` decision and the end-to-end gateway
     decision (no X-PAYMENT -> 402 challenge; X-PAYMENT -> verify -> serve or
     hold), reusing pay.x402's challenge/authorize/entitle philosophy."

;; ── opening the registry to third-party sellers ─────────────────────
;;
;; Everything above works today with ONE seller: the operator. Opening the same
;; registry to third parties is what turns the operator from the counterparty
;; on every flow into the market those flows run through -- the structural
;; change a system-dynamics pass over kotoba-lang/dynamics' archetype catalog
;; ranked third of six for the three-sphere economy (com-junkawasaki/root
;; adr-ledger seq 66, 2026-07-25), grounded in the observation that Visa earns
;; on $17T of OTHER PEOPLE'S transactions and that ERC-20's real leverage was
;; making every subsequent token project free demand surface for Ethereum.
;;
;; Two things have to be true before that is safe, and one of them is a live
;; hijack vector in the code above:
;;
;; 1. `match-rule` treats `:seller nil` as "matches ANY seller". That is a
;;    convenience in a single-tenant registry and an authorization hole the
;;    moment anyone else can add a rule: nexus-x402 routes
;;    `/gateway/<seller>/<path>`, so one wildcard rule would collect payment
;;    for every seller's namespace. `open-registry-errors` rejects it.
;; 2. Within a seller's own namespace, two rules whose prefixes shadow each
;;    other silently make the second unreachable (first match wins). That is a
;;    seller's own problem, but it should be reported at registration rather
;;    than discovered as missing revenue.
;;
;; What this section does NOT do, stated plainly: it does not collect a
;; protocol fee on-chain. It cannot. This facilitator holds zero keys by
;; design, payment goes buyer -> seller's own treasury directly, and x402's
;; requirements carry ONE `pay-to`. Splitting a payment atomically would need a
;; splitter contract that is not deployed and whose deployment is a separate,
;; higher-stakes decision. So the fee is COMPUTED AND RECORDED here, and
;; collection is left explicitly unbuilt -- the same record / custody /
;; governance separation ADR-2607995000 §2 already applies to the treasury
;; (the ledger records, the custodian holds, governance authorizes; no layer
;; does another layer's job).

;; credits->fiat/USDC stays forbidden in both directions, as does credits<->EN.
;; Transferability is not redeemability, so §1's structural non-speculation
;; proof survives: a credit paid to a seller still cannot leave the economy.
;;
;; Why it is worth the code: a non-redeemable unit's value is bounded by the
;; number of distinct things it buys, and before this the only acceptor was the
;; operator's own inference fleet -- an acceptance density of exactly 1, which
;; the system-dynamics pass (com-junkawasaki/root adr-ledger seq 66) named as
;; the binding constraint on the whole credits sphere.
;;
;; This layer stays pure and custody-free for credits exactly as it is for

;; ledger-violations) and injects, the same shape as `onchain-verdict`.

;; ── receivables: the protocol fee as an INVOICE, not an on-chain split ──
;;
;; com-junkawasaki/root ADR-2607320500 §3. Owner requirement (2026-07-31):
;; "資産預かりたくないけど、手数料は欲しい" — do not custody assets, but do
;; collect the fee. Those two are only simultaneously satisfiable one way.
;;
;; `protocol-fee` reports :collectible? false because THIS facilitator cannot
;; take a cut on-chain: it holds no keys and an x402 requirement carries a
;; single `payTo`. Taking a cut atomically needs a splitter contract, and
;; deploying a contract that holds a third party's money is the single decision
;; that was also blocking witness bonds (ADR-2607319800).
;;
;; So the fee is collected the ordinary way instead: the seller receives 100%
;; into their own treasury, and the operator BILLS them. Nothing is ever held
;; on anyone else's behalf, so the money-transmission surface never opens. The
;; cost is credit risk in place of regulatory risk — an ordinary B2B receivable.
;;
;; The non-custodial enforcement lever is service, not funds: a delinquent
;; seller is suspended from the registry (losing discovery/routing), never
;; deprived of money the facilitator does not hold. See `suspension-set`.

;; ── replay protection: one settlement, bounded service ──────────────
;;
;; An x402 `transaction`-scheme payment is proof that a transfer happened. It
;; is NOT proof that the transfer has not already been redeemed: the payload
;; carries a txHash, the chain says that tx is real forever, and nothing in
;; verification is stateful. So without a spent-record, one payment buys
;; unlimited requests. Measured on murakumo.cloud 2026-07-31: the same txHash
;; was presented twice and served twice.
;;
;; The obvious fix -- mark the txHash "spent" on first use -- is wrong here,
;; because it CONFISCATES overpayment. A buyer who sent $0.10 against a $0.01
;; price is owed ten requests, not one; burning the tx on first use would keep
;; $0.09 of their money for nothing. x402 has no change output, so the seller
;; is the only party who can honour the remainder.
;;
;; So the spent-record is an AMOUNT, not a flag: each served request consumes
;; `price` micros of the settled total, and the payment is exhausted when the
;; next request would exceed it. A flag is the degenerate case where price ==
;; paid, and this generalises it without a separate code path.
