  "The first REAL `pay.core/PayRail` — one-shot USDC transfer on Base L2 via
  an ERC-4337 sponsored write.

  `pay`'s README has always named this adapter as the intended backing for
  the rail seam, and until now it did not exist: `unprovisioned-rail` HOLDs
  every operation, honestly, and every consumer got a HOLD. This namespace
  provisions exactly ONE of the six methods.

  WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT STILL HOLDS — the point of the split:

    -pay!               REAL. USDC `transfer(address,uint256)` submitted as a
                        UserOperation through the caller's bundle.
    -pay-stream!        HOLDs. Superfluid adapter does not exist.
    -pay-stream-stop!   HOLDs. Same.
    -split-distribute!  HOLDs. 0xSplits adapter does not exist.
    -escrow-open!       HOLDs. Safe-escrow adapter does not exist.
    -escrow-release!    HOLDs. Same.

  A rail that quietly answered all six would be worse than the unprovisioned
  one, because a HOLD is visible and a fabricated receipt is not. The five
  keep HOLDing with `:pay/unprovisioned-capability`, byte-identical to what
  `unprovisioned-rail` returns, so nothing downstream can tell a
  not-yet-built rail from a not-yet-built method.

  NO KEY IS HELD HERE. The UserOperation is signed inside the caller's
  `SmartAccount` (typically a WebAuthn passkey smart wallet); this namespace
  encodes calldata and reads the receipt. That is `pay`'s standing rule —
  a platform-held signing key is prohibited by design — and this adapter
  does not weaken it.

  REFUSALS ARE HOLDS, NOT EXCEPTIONS. `PayRail`'s contract is that methods
  return data. A payment that must not happen returns a hold map with its
  own reason (`:pay/unresolvable-payee`, `:pay/invalid-amount`,
  `:pay/settlement-reverted`) rather than throwing, so a caller cannot
  swallow a refusal in a `try` and proceed. Transport-level failures — an
  RPC that is down, a bundler that is unreachable — are NOT payment
  decisions and are left to propagate."
