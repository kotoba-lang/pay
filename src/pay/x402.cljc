(ns pay.x402
  "x402 (HTTP 402 Payment Required) protocol codec — pure Clojure/ClojureScript.

  x402 is the open, in-band micropayment protocol Cloudflare's Monetization
  Gateway standardizes (blog.cloudflare.com/monetization-gateway): a gated
  resource answers `402` with its price + accepted asset + pay-to address; the
  buyer (a human wallet OR an autonomous agent) pays in a stablecoin and
  re-requests with an `X-PAYMENT` header carrying proof; a facilitator verifies
  and the resource is served, with an `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` settlement receipt —
  no redirect, no checkout page, no seller onboarding.

  This namespace is the PROTOCOL layer only, matching kotoba-lang/pay's
  invariants: pure .cljc, zero network I/O, zero key custody, zero deps. It
  builds the 402 challenge, validates a decoded payment payload against the
  requirements (scheme / network / recipient / amount / expiry — pure), and
  builds the settlement receipt. The on-chain settle/verify itself is delegated
  to the host — we are our OWN facilitator via kotoba-lang/treasury
  (`verify-payment`) instead of a closed vendor service, and the resource-grant
  decision reuses pay.core's verify-before-honor `entitle` philosophy.

  Two schemes are supported:
  - `\"exact\"` — the canonical x402 EVM scheme: the payload carries an EIP-3009
    `transferWithAuthorization` (gasless USDC transfer) the facilitator submits.
    We validate the authorization's recipient/amount/expiry (pure); the host
    submits + confirms it on-chain.
  - `\"transaction\"` — a fallback where the buyer already broadcast the tx and
    the payload carries its hash. This maps 1:1 onto our existing
    treasury/verify-payment + pay.core/entitle path (club-shinshi's claim flow),
    so an agent and a human wallet share one rail."
